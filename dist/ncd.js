Through various groundwater programs, the USGS actively measures water levels in, or collects data from more than 20,000 of these wells each year. These wells are measured for a variety of disparate purposes, such as statewide monitoring programs, or more local effects like monitoring well drawdown, hydrologic research, aquifer tests, or even earthquake effects on water levels.</p><p>There also are a variety of networks among these actively measured wells; a National Climate Response Network for wells, Regional Networks like the High Plains Aquifer Monitoring Program that is designed to monitor storage changes in the High Plains Aquifer, state-based networks that are designed to monitor statewide groundwater conditions, and local networks designed to monitor pumping effects.</p>" },
